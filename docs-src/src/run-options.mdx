# Run configuration

## Usage 

Here is an example with all the configurations that can be provided to FatRunner.

```typescript
using Yontech.Fat;
using Yontech.Fat.Runner;

// ...

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var options = new FatRunOptions()
    {
        Browser = BrowserType.Chrome,
        Assemblies = new List<Assembly>(){
            typeof(Program).Assembly
        },
        DelayBetweenSteps = 0, 
        DelayBetweenTestCases = 0,
        RunInBackground = false
    };

    FatRunner runner = new FatRunner();
    runner.Run(options);
}
```
> Note that all configs are optional

## Basic config

### Browser
- Type: `BrowserType`
- Default: `BrowserType.Chrome`

It indicates the Browser that will be used to run TestCases.
It can be *Chrome*, *InternetExplorer*, *Firefox* or *Opera*.
> In future versions FatFramework will support running multiple browsers at the same time. Also it might support specific versions of a Browser.

### RunInBackground
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

If set to `true` the browser will run in background. This is very useful especially in continuous integration environment when tests are being executed automatically.        

## Advanced config

### Assemblies
- Type: `List<Assembly>`
- Default: all the assemblies in the project

A list of assemblies in which FatFramework will seach for TestCases.

### DelayBetweenSteps
- Type: `int`
- Default: `0`

The time (in milliseconds) that the runner will wait between test case steps.
> FatFramework is very fast and you might want to slow down a bit so you have time to check what is happening between steps.

### DelayBetweenTestCases
- Type: `int`
- Default: `0`

The time (in milliseconds) that the runner will wait after each test case.
