## Prepare Development Environment

Install latest version of dotnetcore SDK from official website https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download. 
After installation you should be able to execute this command:

<code>
    dotnet --version 
</code>

Install FatFramework command line to quickly get started:

<code>
  dotnet new -i Yontech.Fat.Templates 
</code>

> If you previously installed **dotnet** or **Yontech.Fat.Templates** we recommend to make sure that latest versions are installed

## Create a New Project

Start by running in terminal:

<code>
  dotnet new create-fat-project-with-samples -n YourProjectName
</code>

or, if you don't need code samples, run this:

<code>
  dotnet new create-fat-project -n YourProjectName
</code>

> We recommend using the first command when you are new to FatFramework and you want to learn and follow FatFramework projects structure and guidelines.

## Run testing

To execute test cases run this in terminal:

<code>
    dotnet run 
</code>

> In case that running it throws "permission to execute denied" you should redownload drivers or give permissions to execute to all files inside "drivers" folder.
